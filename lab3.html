    The mobile game that I am currently obsessing over is Cookie Run: Kingdom! 
    The object of the game is to build and expand your own kindgom, while also creating your own team 
    from a variety of cookies to choose from. Ever since the game made its debut in 2021, the developers of 
    the game have only been coming out with stronger and indestructable cookies. This has made advancing levels 
    and in game arena battles, more difficult to complete. As a result, people who grind at the game, have 
    turned to using only cookie in the meta. What is the meta you may ask? The meta refers to a set of strategies 
    that are used on characters and builds that are most effective to advancing in a game. Below will be a grid 
    showing the top six cookies, that are in the games meta currently!

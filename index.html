        <h1>All About Me!</h1>
        <h2>By Taina Gonzalez</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my page! To introduce myself, my name is Taina Gonzalez. I am currently a junior at the College of Staten Island and I'm majoring in Informatics and Information systems. 
            I personally have a fascination with computer software, coding, programs, etc. The career I desire to become a Software Developer. 
            I have previously taken an Intro into C++ class, last semester and have taken a course in Python back in highschool.
            Although I still have a lot to learn, I am eager to go for any opportunity that may offer me experience and knowledge in the field.
            This will be my first web development class in my entire college career and I look forward to all the hands on projects and experience I will gain from completing this course. 
            On a personal note, when I am not in class, I am typically at my part time job, in the gym or relaxing with loved ones. 

        </p>
